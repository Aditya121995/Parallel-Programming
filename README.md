# Parallel-Programming
This program uses  GPU cards to run the code on parallel threads.
In this project I developed a computational tool to calculate likelihood ratio statistic(LRS) value by parallel programming on GPU. 
At the end, I successfully reduced the computational time from 6 minutes to 20 seconds with 98.6 % accuracy of the result.
